# Critique of cross-lagged pannel models

This post summarizes critiques of the traditional cross-lagged panel model (CLPM), and an improved model by Hamaker, Kuiper, and Grasman  [-@Hamakercritiquecrosslaggedpanel2015].

The primary point Hamaker and colleagues make regarding the CLPM is that it assumes that there are "no trait-like individual differences that endure." That is, looking at the structure of a CLPM it is clear that individual-level stability must be accounted for entirely by the auto-regressive path between waves. As they put it, it imposes an assumption that there is no between-subject variance of time-invariant, trait-like stability, but only temporal stability, wave to wave, of subjects around the mean score for any particular wave.

# RI-CLPM

A key insight of the paper is that "we need to separate the _within-person level_ from the _between-person level_" (p. 104). The model they propose, the Random Intercept CLPM (RI-CLPM) separates each person's score on a variable at each wave into the group mean for that wave ($\mu_{t}, \pi_{t}$), an individuals stable score over all waves (the random intercept; $\kappa_{i}, \omega_{i}$) and then an individual level deviation at each wave from the score expected by adding the group-wave-mean and individual trait ($p_{it}, q_{it}$).

The model looks like this:

![RI-CLPM Diagram](hamaker-diagram.png)

Effectively, now, the paths $\alpha_{t}$ (or $\delta_{t}$) between $p_{it}$ (or $q_{it}$) and $p_{i(t+1)}$ (or $q_{i(t+1)}$) no longer capture rank-order stability of individuals, but rather a within-person carry-over effect.

>If it is positive, it implies that occasions on which a person scored above his or her expected score are likely to be followed by occasions on which he or she still scores above the expected score again, and vice versa. (p. 104)

More importantly, since $\kappa$ and $\omega$ separate out individual-level stability, the cross-lagged paths $\beta_{t}$ and $\gamma_{t}$ are now straightforward to interpret as the within person of effect of one variable on the subsequent measurement of a second variable. This interpretive boost is allowed now because, for example, $\beta_{t}$ is the estimate of the additional explanatory power of _deviations from trait-stable levels_ on variable $y_{t}$ on the _deviations_ of the observed variable $x_{t+1}$ from the group mean and individual trait ($\mu_{t+1} + \kappa_{i}$) after accounting for the expected within-person carry-over effect, $\alpha_{t}$. 

See the paper (Figure 2) for a demonstration of how terribly traditional CLPM performs when you have a data generating process that matches the RI-CLPM -- that is, when you have stable individual differences.

## Some data

First, we need some data. I'm using a data set presented on at a methods symposium at SRCD in 1997. Supporting documentation can be found [in this pdf](srcdmeth.pdf). Data and code for importing it was helpfully provided by [Sanjay Srivastava](http://twitter.com/hardsci).

The variables we're considering are a measure of antisocial behavior (`anti`) and reading recognition (`read`). See the docs for descriptions of the other variables. And for the purpose of the model fitting below, `x <- anit` and `y <- read`.

```{r, lavaan demo growth data}
antiread <- read.table("srcddata.dat",
                       na.strings = c("999.00"),
                       col.names = c("anti1", "anti2", "anti3", "anti4", 
                                     "read1", "read2", "read3", "read4",
                                     "gen", "momage", "kidage", "homecog", 
                                     "homeemo", "id")
) %>%
  rename(x1 = anti1, x2 = anti2, x3 = anti3, x4 = anti4,
         y1 = read1, y2 = read2, y3 = read3, y4 = read4) %>%
  select(matches('[xy][1-4]'))

knitr::kable(summary(antiread), format = 'markdown')

antiread %>%
  mutate(pid = 1:n()) %>%
  gather(key, value, -pid) %>%
  extract(col = key, into = c('var', 'wave'), regex = '(\\w)(\\d)') %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = value)) +
  geom_density(alpha = 1) + 
  facet_wrap(~var, nrow = 1, scales = 'free') + 
  theme_classic()
  
antiread %>%
  mutate(pid = 1:n()) %>%
  gather(key, value, -pid) %>%
  extract(col = key, into = c('var', 'wave'), regex = '(\\w)(\\d)') %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = wave, y = value, color = var, group = var)) +
  geom_point(position = position_jitter(w = .2), alpha = .1) +
  geom_line(stat = 'identity', aes(group = interaction(var, pid)), alpha = .04) + 
  geom_line(stat = 'smooth', method = 'lm', size = 1) + 
  theme_classic()

```

## Fitting a RI-CLPM

In the below `lavaan` code, I'll be using the notation from the diagram. I am explicitly specifying everything in the diagram, which is why in the call to `lavaan` I set a bunch of `auto` options to false. This is because often lavaan will try to automatically estimate things that you don't usually write out but often want estimated, like residuals. Because this model is unorthodox, I want to be as explicit as possible.

The lavaan code below uses syntax that can be found in their help docs for the [basic stuff](http://lavaan.ugent.be/tutorial/syntax1.html) as well as the more [advanced](http://lavaan.ugent.be/tutorial/syntax2.html) labeling and constraining.

```{r,lavaan ri-clpm}
riclpmModel <-

#Note, the data contain x1-3 and y1-3
#Latent mean Structure with intercepts

kappa =~ 1*x1 + 1*x2 + 1*x3
omega =~ 1*y1 + 1*y2 + 1*y3

x1 ~ mu1*1 #intercepts
x2 ~ mu2*1
x3 ~ mu3*1
y1 ~ pi1*1

fit <- lavaan(riclpmModel, data = antiread,
              missing = 'ML', #for the missing data!
              int.ov.free = F,
              int.lv.free = F,
              auto.fix.first = F,
              auto.fix.single = F,
              auto.cov.lv.x = F,
              auto.cov.y = F,
              auto.var = F)
summary(fit, standardized = T)
```

## Comparting fits


### RI-CLPM v CLPM

Because the traditional CLPM is nested in the RI-CLPM, we can compare model fit. The correct reference distribution for this comparison is $\chi^2$ but, as Hamaker and colleagues say 

>However, we can make use of the fact that the regular chi-square difference test is conservative in this context, meaning that, if it is significant, we are certain that the correct (i.e., chi-bar-square difference) test will be significant too. (p. 105)

We estimate the traditional CLPM by setting the variance and covariance of $\kappa$ and $\omega$ to 0.

```{r CLPM}
clpmModel <- #yes, "Model" is redundant
'
#Note, the data contain x1-3 and y1-3
#Latent mean Structure with intercepts

kappa =~ 1*x1 + 1*x2 + 1*x3
omega =~ 1*y1 + 1*y2 + 1*y3

x1 ~ mu1*1 #intercepts
x2 ~ mu2*1
x3 ~ mu3*1
y1 ~ pi1*1
y2 ~ pi2*1
y3 ~ pi3*1

kappa ~~ 0*kappa #variance nope
omega ~~ 0*omega #variance nope
kappa ~~ 0*omega #covariance not even

#laten vars for AR and cross-lagged effects
p1 =~ 1*x1 #each factor loading set to 1
p2 =~ 1*x2
p3 =~ 1*x3
q1 =~ 1*y1
q2 =~ 1*y2
q3 =~ 1*y3

#constrain autoregression and cross lagged effects to be the same across both lags.
p3 ~ alpha3*p2 + beta3*q2
p2 ~ alpha2*p1 + beta2*q1

q3 ~ delta3*q2 + gamma3*p2
q2 ~ delta2*q1 + gamma2*p1

p1 ~~ p1 #variance
p2 ~~ u2*p2
p3 ~~ u3*p3
q1 ~~ q1 #variance
q2 ~~ v2*q2
q3 ~~ v3*q3

p1 ~~ q1 #p1 and q1 covariance
p2 ~~ q2 #p2 and q2 covariance
p3 ~~ q3 #p2 and q2 covariance'

fitCLPM <- lavaan(clpmModel, data = antiread,
              missing = 'ML', #for the missing data!
              int.ov.free = F,
              int.lv.free = F,
              auto.fix.first = F,
              auto.fix.single = F,
              auto.cov.lv.x = F,
              auto.cov.y = F,
              auto.var = F)

anova(fit, fitCLPM)
```

It fits much worse, with no model comparison statistic favoring the CLPM (the BIC advantage of 1 point is negligible). We can print out the standardized estimates to compare to the unconstrained RI-CLPM above.

```{r clpm_estimates}
summary(fitCLPM, standardize = T)
```

### Adding constraints to RI-CLPM

For parsimony, I usually try to constraint my autoregressive and cross-lagged paths to be the same across intervals. Oh, and residuals too. I'll do this in the following code and then check the fit against the unconstrained model. To do this, all I have to do is make sure the paths have the same name, like `alpha` instead of `alpha2` and `alpha3`.

```{r constrained}
riclpmModelConstrainedARCL <- 
'
#Note, the data contain x1-3 and y1-3
#Latent mean Structure with intercepts

kappa =~ 1*x1 + 1*x2 + 1*x3
omega =~ 1*y1 + 1*y2 + 1*y3

x1 ~ mu1*1 #intercepts
x2 ~ mu2*1
x3 ~ mu3*1
y1 ~ pi1*1
y2 ~ pi2*1
y3 ~ pi3*1

kappa ~~ kappa #variance
omega ~~ omega #variance
kappa ~~ omega #covariance

#laten vars for AR and cross-lagged effects
p1 =~ 1*x1 #each factor loading set to 1
p2 =~ 1*x2
p3 =~ 1*x3
q1 =~ 1*y1
q2 =~ 1*y2
q3 =~ 1*y3

#constrain autoregression and cross lagged effects to be the same across both lags.
p3 ~ alpha*p2 + beta*q2
p2 ~ alpha*p1 + beta*q1

q3 ~ delta*q2 + gamma*p2
q2 ~ delta*q1 + gamma*p1

p1 ~~ p1 #variance
p2 ~~ u*p2
p3 ~~ u*p3
q1 ~~ q1 #variance
q2 ~~ v*q2
q3 ~~ v*q3

p1 ~~ q1 #p1 and q1 covariance
p2 ~~ uv*q2 #p2 and q2 covariance should also be constrained to be the same as
p3 ~~ uv*q3 #p3 and q3 covariance'

fitConstrainedARCL <- lavaan(riclpmModelConstrainedARCL, data = antiread,
              missing = 'ML', #for the missing data!
              int.ov.free = F,
              int.lv.free = F,
              auto.fix.first = F,
              auto.fix.single = F,
              auto.cov.lv.x = F,
              auto.cov.y = F,
              auto.var = F)

anova(fit, fitConstrainedARCL)
```

Well, according to AIC and the $\chi^2$ test, the constrained model fits worse. But BIC loves the constrained model because it hates parameters. Interpretive ease hates parameters too (most of the time), so let's look at the summary for our simplified model.

```{r summaryconstrained}
summary(fitConstrainedARCL, standardized = T)
```
